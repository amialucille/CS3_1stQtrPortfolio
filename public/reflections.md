# **Q1 End Of Lessons Reflections**
## **Amia Lucille Q. Katigbac of 9-Beryllium**

**List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.**

1. **Development tools -** GitHub and VSCode were the two tools introduced to us at the start of the school year. GitHub is useful for storing my code online and being able to share it easily with just a few clicks. VSCode, on the other hand, is a code editor that allows me to debug and test my code efficiently.  
2. **Syntax for js -** I can say that I’m confident in following JavaScript’s syntax rules since I can apply them correctly (the use of semicolons, following correct structure, etc.). Understanding the syntax helped me when avoiding errors and the proper way to format my code. I can compose simple JavaScript codes that follow the proper syntax rules.
3. **Variable declarations in js -** 
4. **Operations in js -**
5. **Basic js statements -**

**List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.**  

1. **Html tags -** 
2. **Debugging techniques -** 
3. **Loop control structures -** 
4. **Defining functions -** 
5. **Methods within the Number objects to manipulate data -** 

**Describe what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.**
My plan to action in order to help myself in understanding the topics is to try to dedicate more time to do more coding exercises that focus on such topics that I need to full grasp and improve. I will review the notes I take down during class to help me recall the topics. Lastly, I will consult the help of online materials, my classmates, or my teacher to avoid getting stuck and bringing that to the lessons afterward.

**In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think are not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?**
1. Effective:
* Taking down notes - Ever since elementary school, I have always found that taking notes served as an important skill to learn. When writing notes, I only jot down the important points (definition, code syntax, etc.) which I can later on review after class.
* Doing the practice exercises - By doing the practice exercises/speedtests in class, they helped me stimulate my brain to solve the code when I'm pressed for time. Applying what we learned in class in coding practices after each lesson helped me understand the concepts on a deeper level.

2. Ineffective:
* Coming to class unprepared - By coming to class unprepared, I would often zone out and get lost during discussions. This led to me not following the flow of the lecture and having to dedicate more time outside of the classroom to study the topics we had discussed.
* Not reviewing past mistakes before taking tests - Without reviewing my past mistakes before taking tests, this prevented me from seeing what I got wrong/right. Reviewing them allowed me to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
