# **Q1 End Of Lessons Reflections**
## **Amia Lucille Q. Katigbac of 9-Beryllium**

**List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.**

1. **Development tools -** GitHub and VSCode were the two tools introduced to us at the start of the school year. GitHub is useful for storing my code online and being able to share it easily with just a few clicks. VSCode, on the other hand, is a code editor that allows me to debug and test my code efficiently.  
2. **Syntax for js -** I can say that I’m confident in following JavaScript’s syntax rules since I can apply them correctly (the use of semicolons, following correct structure, etc.). Understanding the syntax helped me when avoiding errors and the proper way to format my code. I can compose simple JavaScript codes that follow the proper syntax rules.
3. **Variable declarations in js -**  I can declare variables in JavaScript using 'var', 'let', and 'const'. Each one is used for a different purpose depending on the situation, scope and if the variable value is going to change or not. This allows me to handle data in my programs properly.
4. **Operations in js -** I utilize my critical thinking when I perform a series of operations such as arithmetic, relational, and logical in JavaScript. These operations enable me to manipulate input values, verify them, and generate conditions in my programs. I also use these operations together to solve basic coding problems.
5. **Basic js statements -**  I am comfortable in using the standard input and output in JavaScript, utilizing 'prompt() 'alert()', and 'console.log()'. These functions allow the program to get input from the user and display the output. This makes it very convenient for me when I am testing and debugging my programs.

**List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.**  

1. **Html tags -** I understand the basic structure of an HTML document and the usage of simple tags. But I still struggle to remember the purpose of each tag and know when to use them correctly. More discussion and examples could help me to gain confidence and also to re-enforce my understanding.
2. **Debugging techniques -** I am able to explain how the browser's inspect tool can be used to find errors in the code and also to display the structure of a webpage. However, I still find it hard to completely make use of this tool when the code is lengthy or complicated. I also need more practice in understanding the error message and then fixing the code accordingly.
3. **Loop control structures -** I understand loops in general and what will happen when an infinite loop occurs. But, I do get confused when it comes to real coding situations to break or prevent these loops. More practice will definitely help me in writing safe loops as well as the part of debugging when things go wrong.
4. **Defining functions -** I know how to write a function in JavaScript and the steps of calling a function. Still, I sometimes forget when to use functions efficiently or how to do it correctly. The more I practice, the more I become confident in using functions to solve larger problems.
5. **Methods within the Number objects to manipulate data -** I know the functionalities of each method such as the conversion of strings to numbers and formatting numbers. But, I do not have enough practice to confidently apply them when I come across a new problem. Frequently, I am confused with the methods. So more examples and exercises would be helpful to me.

**Describe what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.**
My plan to action in order to help myself in understanding the topics is to try to dedicate more time to do more coding exercises that focus on such topics that I need to full grasp and improve. I will review the notes I take down during class to help me recall the topics. Lastly, I will consult the help of online materials, my classmates, or my teacher to avoid getting stuck and bringing that to the lessons afterward.

**In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think are not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?**
1. Effective:
* Taking down notes - Ever since elementary school, I have always found that taking notes served as an important skill to learn. When writing notes, I only jot down the important points (definition, code syntax, etc.) which I can later on review after class.
* Doing the practice exercises - By doing the practice exercises/speedtests in class, they helped me stimulate my brain to solve the code when I'm pressed for time. Applying what we learned in class in coding practices after each lesson helped me understand the concepts on a deeper level.

2. Ineffective:
* Coming to class unprepared - By coming to class unprepared, I would often zone out and get lost during discussions. This led to me not following the flow of the lecture and having to dedicate more time outside of the classroom to study the topics we had discussed.
* Not reviewing past mistakes before taking tests - Without reviewing my past mistakes before taking tests, this prevented me from seeing what I got wrong/right. Reviewing them allowed me to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
